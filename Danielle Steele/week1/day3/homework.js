//Array and Functions Bonus Material

//Define a function maxOfTwoNumbers that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Use the if-then-else construct available in Javascript. You'll have to remember your pre-work, or do some googling to figure this out.

//Define a function maxOfThree that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them.

//Write a function that takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns true if it is a vowel, false otherwise.

//Define a function sumArray and a function multiplyArray that sums and multiplies (respectively) all the numbers in an array of numbers. For example, sumArray([1,2,3,4]) should return 10, and multiplyArray([1,2,3,4]) should return 24.


//Homework: The Word Guesser

//You'll create a simple word guessing game where the user gets infinite tries to guess the word (like Hangman without the hangman, or like Wheel //of Fortune without the wheel and fortune).
//
//Create two global arrays: one to hold the letters of the word (e.g. 'F', 'O', 'X'), and one to hold the current guessed letters (e.g. it would //start with '_', '_', '_' and end with 'F', 'O', 'X').
//Write a function called guessLetter that will:
//Take one argument, the guessed letter.
//Iterate through the word letters and see if the guessed letter is in there.
//If the guessed letter matches a word letter, changed the guessed letters array to reflect that.
//When it's done iterating, it should log the current guessed letters ('F__') and congratulate the user if they found a new letter.
//It should also figure out if there are any more letters that need to be guessed, and if not, it should congratulate the user for winning the //game.
//Pretend you don't know the word, and call guessLetter multiple times with various letters to check that your program works.
