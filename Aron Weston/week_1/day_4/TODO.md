# Week #1 - Day 4

### TO DO 

- [] Finish the trig parts of the geo directory
- [] Add the `only one type of number` condition for the credit card project; this probably has something to do with searching the string for duplicates **or** messing around 
- [] Try a variation of the credit card project where each of the conditionals are separated out into individual functions 
- [] Try the double bonus of calculator project - what other functions can we add to it?
- [] Have a go at the JavaScript Bank (not attempted this week)
