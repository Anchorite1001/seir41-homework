```js
const n = ['Times Square', '34th', '28th', '23rd', 'Union Square', '8th'];
const l = ['8th', '6th', 'Union Square', '3rd', '1st'];
const six = ['Grand Central', '33rd', '28th', '23rd', 'Union Square', 'Astor Place']
```

- The function takes two sets of paramaters:
    1. Origin line and stop
    2. Destination line and stop 

What do I need the program to do? 

1. Show the remaining stops left on the line, at the point of origin
2. Do you need to change at union square? Are you changing lines? 
3. If you need to switch at union square 

If you want to go to **destination**, then 




'Times Square', '34th', '28th', '23rd', 'Union Square', '8th'
